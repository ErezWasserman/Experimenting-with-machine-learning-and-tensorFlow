Make sure the 4 data / meta-data files and the 2 python scripts (ML_predict_childs_by_income.py, read_data_files.py) are place in the running folder.

Import the script with its functions: 
>>> import ML_predict_childs_by_income

Then adjust the hyperparams for the model and train:
>>> ML_predict_childs_by_income.train_model(
    learning_rate=0.009,
        steps=400,
        batch_size=1000
    )
    
Look for hyperparams values which will lead to optimal convergence.
