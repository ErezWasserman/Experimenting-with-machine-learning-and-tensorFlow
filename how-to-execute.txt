Make sure the 4 data files (*.dat, *.dct) and the 2 python scripts (ML_predict_childs_by_income.py, read_data_files.py) 
are placed in the running folder.

Import the module which contains the ML functions: 
>>> import ML_predict_childs_by_income

Then use the 'train_model' function and adjust the hyperparams, for example:
>>> ML_predict_childs_by_income.train_model(
    learning_rate=0.009,
        steps=400,
        batch_size=1000
    )
    
Look for hyperparams values which will lead to optimal convergence of the model.

(Note - tensorFlow requires python 3.x environment)
